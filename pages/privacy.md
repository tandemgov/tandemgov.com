# Privacy Policy

{{ seo_description }}

## Collecting

The website, the tandemgov.com app, and fargo (collectively, "our applications") do not collect, store, or share information about you, with two exceptions: (1) we record and use the Internet Protocol address of your computer to recognize and defend against denial-of-service and other technical attacks, and to understand overall usage patterns; (2) we require user accounts tied to an email address for authentication and authorization purposes.

## Tracking

Whether you use the Do Not Track HTTP header feature of your web browser or not, our applications do not use cookies or other ways to track you. They don't direct your computer to make requests to other websites or services for tracking purposes, either.

## Sharing

Our applications do not share any information about you with advertisers, marketing companies, or anyone else.

## Service Providers

Our applications use the following service providers:

- Netlify and Amazon Web Services for hosting
- Slack for @fargo
- Google and LinkedIn for OAuth for app.tandemgov.com

You should look at the privacy notices of each of those service providers, as well. Their policies may differ from this one.

## Contact

If you have comments or questions about these privacy policies, you can contact us via e-mail at hello@tandemov.com.

## Changes

We may change our applications' privacy policies at any time. Check this page for the latest.
